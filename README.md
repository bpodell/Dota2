## Overview

This is a stat tracker for the videogame DOTA 2. It displays all the heroes on the landing page and upon a click, the user can inspect the "hero" further to see updated stats and details. 

## Getting Started

The dependencies we used in this project are listed in our package.json file and are as follows: bodyparser, cors, fileshare, postgres, superagent, and express. 

## Architecture

This is a Single Page Application, we use Javascript to hide and show different elements, and use on click events to let the user change the display. The main technologies are Javascript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery, as well as our dependencies.
